- Existing code continues to function
- Gradual migration supported

### 🔄 Migration Notes

To use the new features:

1. **Automatic** - Dependencies added to build.gradle
2. **Optional** - Migrate JSON data to Room database
3. **Recommended** - Use Repository instead of InvoiceStore
4. **Best Practice** - Use ViewModel for screen state

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for detailed migration guide.
