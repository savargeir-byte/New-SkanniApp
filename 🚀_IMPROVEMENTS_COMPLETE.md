## 🎯 How to Use

### Quick Start (2 minutes)

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

2. **Run on device**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

3. **That's it!** All improvements are active! ✅

### Using New Features

#### Option 1: Keep Using Old Code (Works!)
```kotlin
// Old InvoiceStore still works
val invoiceStore = InvoiceStore(context)
val notes = invoiceStore.loadAll()
```

#### Option 2: Migrate to New System (Recommended)
```kotlin
// New Repository pattern
val repository = InvoiceRepository(context)
lifecycleScope.launch {
    repository.getAllFlow().collect { invoices ->
        // Automatic updates!
    }
}
```

#### Option 3: Use ViewModel (Best Practice)
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen(viewModel: InvoiceViewModel = viewModel()) {
    val invoices by viewModel.invoices.collectAsState()
    val stats by viewModel.statistics.collectAsState()
    // Professional architecture!
}
```

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for complete examples!

## 🔄 Migration Path (Optional)

Your old code still works! But to get full benefits:

### Step 1: One-Time Data Migration
```kotlin
// Run once to migrate JSON → Room
lifecycleScope.launch {
    val oldStore = InvoiceStore(context)
    val repository = InvoiceRepository(context)
    
    val oldData = oldStore.loadAll()
    if (oldData.isNotEmpty()) {
        repository.insertAll(oldData).onSuccess {
            oldStore.clearAll()
            Toast.makeText(context, "Migrated!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Update Code Gradually
Replace `InvoiceStore` with `InvoiceRepository` as you go.  
No rush! Both work! ✅
